# Collection Badges - Test Implementation

## ✅ **Implementation Complete!**

### **What's Been Done:**

1. **✅ Collection Meta Field Created**
   - Added `custom.collection_badges_simple` meta field for collections
   - Same simple format as product badges

2. **✅ Badge Priority System Implemented**
   - Collection badges take priority over product badges
   - Falls back to product badges if no collection badges
   - Maintains existing sale/sold out badges

3. **✅ Template Updates**
   - Updated `product-card-badges.liquid` to check collection first
   - Updated collection template to pass collection object
   - Updated product card blocks to pass collection through

4. **✅ Documentation Updated**
   - Created comprehensive setup guide
   - Added collection-specific quick guide
   - Updated existing documentation

### **How to Test:**

1. **Create Collection Meta Field:**
   - Go to Settings → Custom data → Collections
   - Add definition: `custom.collection_badges_simple`
   - Type: Multi-line text

2. **Add Badges to Collection:**
   - Go to Products → Collections
   - Select any collection
   - Add badges like: `New Collection|#00C851|#FFFFFF`

3. **Verify on Storefront:**
   - Visit the collection page
   - All products should show the collection badges
   - Individual product badges should be overridden

### **Expected Behavior:**

- **Collection with badges** → Show collection badges on all products
- **Collection without badges** → Show individual product badges (if any)
- **No badges at all** → Show only default sale/sold out badges

### **Files Modified:**

- `config/meta_fields.json` - Added collection meta field
- `snippets/product-card-badges.liquid` - Updated badge logic
- `blocks/_product-card-gallery.liquid` - Pass collection object
- `sections/main-collection.liquid` - Pass collection to product cards
- `blocks/_product-card.liquid` - Pass collection through blocks

### **Ready to Use!**

The collection-level badge system is now fully implemented and ready to use. You can set badges once for an entire collection instead of having to set them for each individual product.
